# ASCII Booth

## Workshop

Example code for ASCII Art Workshop, you can see my slide deck for the workshop [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Nw9mhDMhFUh3177_jK4VO6oqLEWSHfDiUBm6X06RSaw/edit?usp=sharing)

### Further reading

Below are some of the sources I used whilst researching the history of ASCII art and how to build an image to ASCII Art converter:

- [ASCII Art FAQ](https://www.asciiart.eu/faq)
- [Joan G. Stark's History of ASCII](http://artscene.textfiles.com/asciiart/texthistory.txt) can also be found [here](https://github.com/khrome/ascii-art-docs/blob/master/History.md)
- [More from Joan G. Stark](https://web.archive.org/web/20160912041244/http://www.ludd.luth.se/~vk/pics/ascii/junkyard/techstuff/tutorials/Joan_Stark.html#life)
- The Coding Train [video on converting images to ASCII](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/166-image-to-ascii) (which inspired me to choose this project)

### Interesting ASCII projects

I came across some fun ASCII Art projects by other people whilst working on this project, here are some of my favourites:

- This [text to ASCII font converter](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Type%20Something%20) by Patrick Gillespie is a lot of fun to play around with, it's interesting to see all the creative ways people have used ASCII to achieve different styles of text.

### A long tradition of ASCII Photo Booths

I'm far from the first person to build a photo booth that converters pictures to ASCII Art! Below is a list of some examples I encountered whilst researching for this project:
